Opinionated Cloud Architecture.
Infraprints is a collection of terraform modules that defined very opinionated architecture. Each module tries to express intent, and a strictly defined purpose for the resources. This helps prevent the fragile architecture designs.
Motivations While doing a lot of cloud development work I have found that when the modules provide a lot of customization potential, it results in these very fragile deployments. This is just anecdotal, but I wanted to do something to help alleviate this problem for myself.</description></item></channel></rss>
