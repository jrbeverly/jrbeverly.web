We also have early-stage oci_image, oci_push, etc. aliases for folks that enjoy the consistency of a consistent rule prefix. The only place the format-specific names currently do any more than alias things is in foo_push, where they also specify the appropriate format as which to publish the image.\nOverview This repository contains a set of rules for pulling down base images, augmenting them with build artifacts and assets, and publishing those images. These rules do not require / use Docker for pulling, building, or pushing images. This means:\n They can be used to develop Docker containers on OSX without boot2docker or docker-machine installed. Note use of these rules on Windows is currently not supported. They do not require root access on your workstation.  Also, unlike traditional container builds (e.g. Dockerfile), the Docker images produced by container_image are deterministic / reproducible.\nTo get started with building Docker images, check out the examples that build the same images using both rules_docker and a Dockerfile.\nNOTE: container_push and container_pull make use of google/go-containerregistry for registry interactions.\nLanguage Rules  py_image (signature) py3_image (signature) nodejs_image (usage) java_image (signature) war_image (signature) scala_image (signature) groovy_image (signature) cc_image (signature) go_image (signature) rust_image (signature) d_image (signature)  It is notable that: cc_image, go_image, rust_image, and d_image also allow you to specify an external binary target.\nDocker Rules This repo now includes rules that provide additional functionality to install packages and run commands inside docker containers. These rules, however, require a docker binary is present and properly configured. These rules include:\n Package manager rules: rules to install apt-get packages. Docker run rules: rules to run commands inside docker containers.  Overview In addition to low-level rules for building containers, this repository provides a set of higher-level rules for containerizing applications. The idea behind these rules is to make containerizing an application built via a lang_binary rule as simple as changing it to lang_image.\nBy default these higher level rules make use of the distroless language runtimes, but these can be overridden via the base=\u0026quot;...\u0026quot; attribute (e.g. with a container_pull or container_image target).\nNote also that these rules do not expose any docker related attributes. If you need to add a custom env or symlink to a lang_image, you must use container_image targets for this purpose. Specifically, you can use as base for your lang_image target a container_image target that adds e.g., custom env or symlink. Please see go_image (custom base)for an example.\nSetup Add the following to your WORKSPACE file to add the external repositories:\nload(\u0026#34;@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;http_archive\u0026#34;) http_archive( # Get copy paste instructions for the http_archive attributes from the # release notes at https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker/releases ) # OPTIONAL: Call this to override the default docker toolchain configuration. # This call should be placed BEFORE the call to \u0026#34;container_repositories\u0026#34; below # to actually override the default toolchain configuration. # Note this is only required if you actually want to call # docker_toolchain_configure with a custom attr; please read the toolchains # docs in /toolchains/docker/ before blindly adding this to your WORKSPACE. # BEGIN OPTIONAL segment: load(\u0026#34;@io_bazel_rules_docker//toolchains/docker:toolchain.bzl\u0026#34;, docker_toolchain_configure=\u0026#34;toolchain_configure\u0026#34; ) docker_toolchain_configure( name = \u0026#34;docker_config\u0026#34;, # OPTIONAL: Bazel target for the build_tar tool, must be compatible with build_tar.py build_tar_target=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;enter absolute path (i.e., must start with repo name @...//:...) to an executable build_tar target\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, # OPTIONAL: Path to a directory which has a custom docker client config.json. # See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/#configuration-files # for more details. client_config=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;enter absolute path to your docker config directory here\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, # OPTIONAL: Path to the docker binary. # Should be set explicitly for remote execution. docker_path=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;enter absolute path to the docker binary (in the remote exec env) here\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, # OPTIONAL: Path to the gzip binary. gzip_path=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;enter absolute path to the gzip binary (in the remote exec env) here\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, # OPTIONAL: Bazel target for the gzip tool. gzip_target=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;enter absolute path (i.e., must start with repo name @...//:...) to an executable gzip target\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, # OPTIONAL: Path to the xz binary. # Should be set explicitly for remote execution. xz_path=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;enter absolute path to the xz binary (in the remote exec env) here\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, # OPTIONAL: Bazel target for the xz tool. # Either xz_path or xz_target should be set explicitly for remote execution. xz_target=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;enter absolute path (i.e., must start with repo name @...//:...) to an executable xz target\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, # OPTIONAL: List of additional flags to pass to the docker command. docker_flags = [ \u0026#34;--tls\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;--log-level=info\u0026#34;, ], ) # End of OPTIONAL segment. load( \u0026#34;@io_bazel_rules_docker//repositories:repositories.bzl\u0026#34;, container_repositories = \u0026#34;repositories\u0026#34;, ) container_repositories() load(\u0026#34;@io_bazel_rules_docker//repositories:deps.bzl\u0026#34;, container_deps = \u0026#34;deps\u0026#34;) container_deps() load( \u0026#34;@io_bazel_rules_docker//container:container.bzl\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;container_pull\u0026#34;, ) container_pull( name = \u0026#34;java_base\u0026#34;, registry = \u0026#34;gcr.io\u0026#34;, repository = \u0026#34;distroless/java\u0026#34;, # \u0026#39;tag\u0026#39; is also supported, but digest is encouraged for reproducibility. digest = \u0026#34;sha256:deadbeef\u0026#34;, ) Known Issues  Bazel does not deal well with diamond dependencies.  If the repositories that are imported by container_repositories() have already been imported (at a different version) by other rules you called in your WORKSPACE, which are placed above the call to container_repositories(), arbitrary errors might occur. If you get errors related to external repositories, you will likely not be able to use container_repositories() and will have to import directly in your WORKSPACE all the required dependencies (see the most up to date impl of container_repositories() for details).\n ImportError: No module named moves.urllib.parse  This is an example of an error due to a diamond dependency. If you get this error, make sure to import rules_docker before other libraries, so that six can be patched properly.\nSee https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker/issues/1022 for more details.\n Ensure your project has a BUILD or BUILD.bazel file at the top level. This can be a blank file if necessary. Otherwise you might see an error that looks like:  Unable to load package for //:WORKSPACE: BUILD file not found in any of the following directories. Using with Docker locally. Suppose you have a container_image target //my/image:helloworld:\ncontainer_image( name = \u0026#34;helloworld\u0026#34;, ... ) You can load this into your local Docker client by running: bazel run my/image:helloworld.\nFor the lang_image targets, this will also run the container using docker run to maximize compatibility with lang_binary rules.\nArguments to this command are forwarded to docker, meaning the command\nbazel run my/image:helloworld -- -p 8080:80 -- arg0 performs the following steps:\n load the my/image:helloworld target into your local Docker client start a container using this image where arg0 is passed to the image entrypoint port forward 8080 on the host to port 80 on the container, as per docker run documentation  You can suppress this behavior by passing the single flag: bazel run :foo -- --norun\nAlternatively, you can build a docker load compatible bundle with: bazel build my/image:helloworld.tar. This will produce the file: bazel-bin/my/image/helloworld.tar, which you can load into your local Docker client by running: docker load -i bazel-bin/my/image/helloworld.tar. Building this target can be expensive for large images.\nThese work with both container_image, container_bundle, and the lang_image rules. For everything except container_bundle, the image name will be bazel/my/image:helloworld. For container_bundle, it will apply the tags you have specified.\nAuthentication You can use these rules to access private images using standard Docker authentication methods. e.g. to utilize the Google Container Registry. See here for authentication methods.\nSee also:\n Amazon ECR Docker Credential Helper Azure Docker Credential Helper  Once you\u0026rsquo;ve setup your docker client configuration, see here for an example of how to use container_pull with custom docker authentication credentials and here for an example of how to use container_push with custom docker authentication credentials.\nVarying image names A common request from folks using container_push, container_bundle, or container_image is to be able to vary the tag that is pushed or embedded. There are two options at present for doing this.\nStamping The first option is to use stamping. Stamping is enabled when bazel is run with --stamp. This enables replacements in stamp-aware attributes. A python format placeholder (e.g. {BUILD_USER}) is replaced by the value of the corresponding workspace-status variable.\n# A common pattern when users want to avoid trampling # on each other\u0026#39;s images during development. container_push( name = \u0026#34;publish\u0026#34;, format = \u0026#34;Docker\u0026#34;, # Any of these components may have variables. registry = \u0026#34;gcr.io\u0026#34;, repository = \u0026#34;my-project/my-image\u0026#34;, # This will be replaced with the current user when built with --stamp tag = \u0026#34;{BUILD_USER}\u0026#34;, )  Rules that are sensitive to stamping can also be forced to stamp or non-stamp mode irrespective of the --stamp flag to Bazel. Use the build_context_data rule to make a target that provides StampSettingInfo, and pass this to the build_context_data attribute.\n The next natural question is: \u0026ldquo;Well what variables can I use?\u0026rdquo; This option consumes the workspace-status variables Bazel defines in bazel-out/stable-status.txt and bazel-out/volatile-status.txt.\n Note that changes to the stable-status file cause a rebuild of the action, while volatile-status does not.\n You can add more stamp variables via --workspace_status_command, see the bazel docs. A common example is to provide the current git SHA, with --workspace_status_command=\u0026quot;echo STABLE_GIT_SHA $(git rev-parse HEAD)\u0026quot;\nThat flag is typically passed in the .bazelrc file, see for example .bazelrc in kubernetes.\nMake variables The second option is to employ Makefile-style variables:\ncontainer_bundle( name = \u0026#34;bundle\u0026#34;, images = { \u0026#34;gcr.io/$(project)/frontend:latest\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;//frontend:image\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;gcr.io/$(project)/backend:latest\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;//backend:image\u0026#34;, } ) These variables are specified on the CLI using:\nbazel build --define project=blah //path/to:bundle Debugging lang_image rules By default the lang_image rules use the distroless base runtime images, which are optimized to be the minimal set of things your application needs at runtime. That can make debugging these containers difficult because they lack even a basic shell for exploring the filesystem.\nTo address this, we publish variants of the distroless runtime images tagged :debug, which are the exact-same images, but with additions such as busybox to make debugging easier.\nFor example (in this repo):\n$ bazel run -c dbg testdata:go_image ... INFO: Build completed successfully, 5 total actions INFO: Running command line: bazel-bin/testdata/go_image Loaded image ID: sha256:9c5c2167a1db080a64b5b401b43b3c5cdabb265b26cf7a60aabe04a20da79e24 Tagging 9c5c2167a1db080a64b5b401b43b3c5cdabb265b26cf7a60aabe04a20da79e24 as bazel/testdata:go_image Hello, world! $ docker run -ti --rm --entrypoint=sh bazel/testdata:go_image -c \u0026#34;echo Hello, busybox.\u0026#34; Hello, busybox.

Note you might need to set strip_prefix = \u0026quot;.\u0026quot; or strip_prefix = \u0026quot;{some directory}\u0026quot; in your rule for the files to not be flattened. See Bazel upstream issue 2176and rules_docker issue 317for more details.\ncc_image To use cc_image, add the following to WORKSPACE:\nload( \u0026#34;@io_bazel_rules_docker//repositories:repositories.bzl\u0026#34;, container_repositories = \u0026#34;repositories\u0026#34;, ) container_repositories() load( \u0026#34;@io_bazel_rules_docker//cc:image.bzl\u0026#34;, _cc_image_repos = \u0026#34;repositories\u0026#34;, ) _cc_image_repos() Then in your BUILD file, simply rewrite cc_binary to cc_image with the following import:\nload(\u0026#34;@io_bazel_rules_docker//cc:image.bzl\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cc_image\u0026#34;) cc_image( name = \u0026#34;cc_image\u0026#34;, srcs = [\u0026#34;cc_image.cc\u0026#34;], deps = [\u0026#34;:cc_image_library\u0026#34;], ) cc_image (external binary) To use cc_image (or go_image, d_image, rust_image) with an external cc_binary (or the like) target, then your BUILD file should instead look like:\nload(\u0026#34;@io_bazel_rules_docker//cc:image.bzl\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cc_image\u0026#34;) cc_binary( name = \u0026#34;cc_binary\u0026#34;, srcs = [\u0026#34;cc_binary.cc\u0026#34;], deps = [\u0026#34;:cc_library\u0026#34;], ) cc_image( name = \u0026#34;cc_image\u0026#34;, binary = \u0026#34;:cc_binary\u0026#34;, ) If you need to modify somehow the container produced by cc_image (e.g., env, symlink), see note above in Language Rules Overviewabout how to do this and see go_image (custom base)example below.\npy_image To use py_image, add the following to WORKSPACE:\nload( \u0026#34;@io_bazel_rules_docker//repositories:repositories.bzl\u0026#34;, container_repositories = \u0026#34;repositories\u0026#34;, ) container_repositories() load( \u0026#34;@io_bazel_rules_docker//python:image.bzl\u0026#34;, _py_image_repos = \u0026#34;repositories\u0026#34;, ) _py_image_repos() Then in your BUILD file, simply rewrite py_binary to py_image with the following import:\nload(\u0026#34;@io_bazel_rules_docker//python:image.bzl\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;py_image\u0026#34;) py_image( name = \u0026#34;py_image\u0026#34;, srcs = [\u0026#34;py_image.py\u0026#34;], deps = [\u0026#34;:py_image_library\u0026#34;], main = \u0026#34;py_image.py\u0026#34;, ) If you need to modify somehow the container produced by py_image (e.g., env, symlink), see note above in Language Rules Overviewabout how to do this and see go_image (custom base)example below.\nIf you are using py_image with a custom base that has python tools installed in a location different to the default base, please see Python tools.\npy_image (fine layering) For Python and Java\u0026rsquo;s lang_image rules, you can factor dependencies that don\u0026rsquo;t change into their own layers by overriding the layers=[] attribute. Consider this sample from the rules_k8s repository:\npy_image( name = \u0026#34;server\u0026#34;, srcs = [\u0026#34;server.py\u0026#34;], # \u0026#34;layers\u0026#34; is just like \u0026#34;deps\u0026#34;, but it also moves the dependencies each into # their own layer, which can dramatically improve developer cycle time. For # example here, the grpcio layer is ~40MB, but the rest of the app is only # ~400KB. By partitioning things this way, the large grpcio layer remains # unchanging and we can reduce the amount of image data we repush by ~99%! layers = [ requirement(\u0026#34;grpcio\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;//examples/hellogrpc/proto:py\u0026#34;, ], main = \u0026#34;server.py\u0026#34;, ) You can also implement more complex fine layering strategies by using the py_layer rule and its filter attribute. For example:\n# Suppose that we are synthesizing an image that depends on a complex set # of libraries that we want to break into layers. LIBS = [ \u0026#34;//pkg/complex_library\u0026#34;, # ... ] # First, we extract all transitive dependencies of LIBS that are under //pkg/common. py_layer( name = \u0026#34;common_deps\u0026#34;, deps = LIBS, filter = \u0026#34;//pkg/common\u0026#34;, ) # Then, we further extract all external dependencies of the deps under //pkg/common. py_layer( name = \u0026#34;common_external_deps\u0026#34;, deps = [\u0026#34;:common_deps\u0026#34;], filter = \u0026#34;@\u0026#34;, ) # We also extract all external dependencies of LIBS, which is a superset of # \u0026#34;:common_external_deps\u0026#34;. py_layer( name = \u0026#34;external_deps\u0026#34;, deps = LIBS, filter = \u0026#34;@\u0026#34;, ) # Finally, we create the image, stacking the above filtered layers on top of one # another in the \u0026#34;layers\u0026#34; attribute. The layers are applied in order, and any # dependencies already added to the image will not be added again. Therefore, # \u0026#34;:external_deps\u0026#34; will only add the external dependencies not present in # \u0026#34;:common_external_deps\u0026#34;. py_image( name = \u0026#34;image\u0026#34;, deps = LIBS, layers = [ \u0026#34;:common_external_deps\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;:common_deps\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;:external_deps\u0026#34;, ], # ... ) py3_image To use a Python 3 runtime instead of the default of Python 2, use py3_image, instead of py_image. The other semantics are identical.\nIf you need to modify somehow the container produced by py3_image (e.g., env, symlink), see note above in Language Rules Overviewabout how to do this and see go_image (custom base)example below.\nIf you are using py3_image with a custom base that has python tools installed in a location different to the default base, please see Python tools.\nnodejs_image It is notable that unlike the other image rules, nodejs_image is not currently using the gcr.io/distroless/nodejs image for a handful of reasons.

Flags in the recommended .bazelrc file force all host tools to use python 2. If your project requires using host tools that are only compatible with python 3 you will not be able to use these features at the moment. We expect this issue to be resolved before use of python toolchain features becomes the default.\nUpdating the distroless base images.

An example would be an s3_archive rule that can retrieve these tools from an AWS S3 Bucket responsible for storing these binaries.\nThe aim of this would be to enable the above rules (register_external_toolchain(s)) to support tools or systems that augment the processing of the read toolchain file. If done right, it would allow something like mirroring all toolchain dependencies to an internal store with minimal manual intervention:\n Run a command to download all the toolchains to a custom local directory (toolchains download --directory \u0026lt;xyz\u0026gt;) Upload this directory to a minio or hosted file store (aws s3 sync --recursive \u0026lt;xyz\u0026gt;/ s3://...)

These secrets are necessary for all web-enabled machines.\nThe sample of these look like so:\nexport NAMECHEAP_TOKEN=\u0026#39;xyz\u0026#39; export OPENVPN_USERNAME=\u0026#39;pXX123\u0026#39; export OPENVPN_PASSWORD=\u0026#39;abc\u0026#39; Structure All docker related outputs are dumped to the /srv directory. THis acts as the root for the docker containers running on any of the servers. The top level contains the docker-compose YAML files that define what is running on the machine. This is split into different kinds of components (nginx, server, utility) to make it easier to share concepts between machines.\nThe intended directory structure is like so:\n\u0026gt; srv/ \u0026gt; etc/ : secrets, environment variables and configuration data \u0026gt; data/ : data shared between the deployed server \u0026gt; tmp/ : temporary data (or data that can be destroyed + recreated) The code uses copy-over-ref for the YAML configuration to allow each machine to be slightly unique in its configuration if the need presents itself.\nNotes I\u0026rsquo;ve been running variations of my home network for a while now, with varying degrees of complexity. Some times running a full suite of software development tooling, or just running a couple of simple websites for hosting home media/photos. The biggest issue I\u0026rsquo;ve had is with configuration getting out of date.\nEven when tracking the docker-compose files in GitHub, they tended to get out-of-sync as the way of making changes was to scp+docker-compose up or git pull+docker-compose up. Eventually they would get in a bad state, remain in that state for a while due to time constraints, and just be a pain.\nSwitching to ansible for this, along with this design structure is intended to remove this annoying burden, by making ansible the primary way to make changes. Any changes that exist within /srv that is infrastructure related that is not managed by ansible should be blown away.\nThis hopefully will make issues related to the docker images less of a problem in the long term for running this infrastructure.\n","id":48,"section":"posts","summary":"HomeLab - Internal Tooling Ansible playbooks for configuring services running within my internal home cloud.\nGetting Started DevContainers The DevContainer environment can be started by opening the repository in VSCode and installing the \u0026lsquo;Remote - Containers\u0026rsquo; extension.

Early experiments with cloud-driven development environments configured on-demand using terraform.\nInitial exploratory work for seeing what changes exist in the workflows, and any issues that may arise as a result of working in Lightsail.\nNotes Below are some quick points noted while experimenting with this:\nAWS Access Keys In comparison to running this on ECS or EC2, AWS access keys need to be generated and supplied if you wish to run AWS commands.\nThis is nice to some degree if I rely on aws sso to have temporary credentials. Each instance can then focus on being configured for aws sso (or related sso tooling) to get keys.\nPulling data from the instance would be an issue, and make cross-cutting concerns (like backups / logging) more difficult.\nBaked Images Unlike ECS or EC2, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t offer the options of pre-baking an image. That would be ideal, as it would allow for layering (base -\u0026gt; developer -\u0026gt; devops -\u0026gt; admin) that has the minimum necessary tools and recommended specs. Branching could also be an option depending on the type of workloads (perf, load, cross-browser validation).\nProvisioning with a single shell script works fine for the demo, but a fully featured environment would need something like ansible.\nPorts Terraform doesn\u0026rsquo;t support defining the ports at this time, and requires a workaround mechanism. This isn\u0026rsquo;t ideal, and makes it difficult to have a more flexible model.\nManual modification of the firewall is less than ideal, as the desired intent is to be completely automated.

We present an actor-critic, model-free algorithm based on the deterministic policy gradient that can operate over continuous action spaces. Using the same learning algorithm, network architecture and hyper-parameters, our algorithm robustly solves more than 20 simulated physics tasks, including classic problems such as cartpole swing-up, dexterous manipulation, legged locomotion and car driving. Our algorithm is able to find policies whose performance is competitive with those found by a planning algorithm with full access to the dynamics of the domain and its derivatives.

I split the function into the computation of two components: reward and penalty. I wanted to incentivize the agent into certain behaviours, while discouraging results that were not optimal. I describe it this way, because I wished to reflect these ideas:\n If you are stable, you have a lower penalty. If you are reckless (flying sideways), you have a higher penalty. The closer you are, the lower the penalty. The further you are, the higher the penalty. You are rewarded for proximity (cumulative) You are rewarded for still flying  These ideas didn\u0026rsquo;t translate well in the end, and in the end only a weighted distance was used for computing the reward. You can see that reward=0 =\u0026gt; abs(0-penalty) = penalty for the function. This means that most of the code in the get_reward function is not actually needed.

At the time I was tinkering with ideas about chat-ops like services that could be used to manage key rotation in external services. This lead to some experiments with Hubot and AWS Lambda. I thought this example would offer sufficient complexity for tinkering with the idea of a lambda-based application for working with different services. The ideas were as follows:\n If each service is its own lambda, permissions to service tokens (GitHub / CircleCI / TravisCI / Jenkins) can be locked down at the route level Each service token could have its own secret store, allowing granular access permissions Rotations would occur on set intervals, which meant the service didn\u0026rsquo;t need to remain running at all times Trigger actions (revocations / deletes / freezes) could be trigger by API Routes Authentication could potentially leverage existing AWS services (useful for a secure service)  Terraform I had originally intended to write this in terraform, however at time of development (\u0026amp; writing), Terraform does not have support for the new version of API Gateway (V2). I have included CloudFormation in Terraform prototype in the directory tests/ for future reference. Rather than trying to get this working, I looked for ways to setup a terraform-like experience in cloudformation.\nCfPack I used cfpack.js to split the cloudformation template into smaller templates. Although this added another dependency (\u0026amp; build step), I found it a lot easier to work with multiple smaller templates as opposed to one big one. I did some early experiments with nested stacks, but personally found it like juggling.\n cfpack is a small CLI tool that can help you to deal with huge CloudFormation templates by splitting it into multiple smaller templates. Using this tool you can also build sharable drop-in templates that you can share across your projects.\n ","id":67,"section":"posts","summary":"AWS Chat App SAM Application for a simple chat application based on API Gateways new WebSocket API feature.

With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.\n CardboardCI aims to create a collection of docker images that can be used in continuous integration. These images will have all dependencies pinned, to ensure that any commit will produce the exact same image (or as close to as possible). The aim of this repository is to build docker-awscli in Bazel, to evaluate whether it would help fit those goals.\nAdditionally it helps to test whether Bazel could work under GitHub Actions, or would require another service to build.\nNotes If I were to use this for CardboardCI, I\u0026rsquo;d probably need to develop/use packer manager rules for the following:\n GitHub Releases NPM RubyGems AptGet  And potentially some edge cases with LaTeX and Lua (luarocks).\nPackage Manager Rules For the package managers that would need rules, they would follow the format of the existing download_pkgs (f(deps[]) =\u0026gt; tarball). Most of the package managers used in CardboardCI have some way to download but not install the packages. Here are some examples of the rule usages:\ndownload_npm( name = \u0026#34;pkgs\u0026#34;, image_tar = \u0026#34;@ubuntu//image\u0026#34;, packages = [ \u0026#34;surge:0.0.1\u0026#34;, ], # Could we read all of the packages from a file? # packages_file = \u0026#34;:file\u0026#34; ) If the rule could support a way of providing a file, then the same automated process as now could be used for upgrading the dependencies. The big problem I see with this is that if only 1 dependency changes, we must re-download all of the other dependencies. The option of bazel-ifying each dependency as a rule would create problems with updating (e.g. how to update version). This isn\u0026rsquo;t too bad if there exists a file like so:\nload(\u0026#34;@io_bazel_rules_docker//docker/package_managers:download_npm.bzl\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;download_npm\u0026#34;) download_npm( name = \u0026#34;pkg_surge\u0026#34;, image_tar = \u0026#34;@ubuntu//image\u0026#34;, src = \u0026#34;:surge.dep\u0026#34; ) With the .dep file looking something like this:\nname=\u0026#34;surge\u0026#34; version=\u0026#34;0.0.1\u0026#34; Conclusions Below I have included jot notes for my conclusions on using Bazel to build docker images for CardboardCI:\n Most of the images can be built using Bazel Some images may require bazel-ifying the source projects Windows support is lacking, and the resulting errors are difficult to investigate The errors are sometimes opaque (e.g. /tmp/installer OCI runtime error) Bazel rules would be needed for other package managers (npm, rubygems, luarocks, etc) container_run_and_commit allows for half-in half-out development Having each image defined with bazel could have some benefits if it was all-in  I don\u0026rsquo;t feel that there is a compelling reason to try and implement the docker images in Bazel, and more than enough reasons why it isn\u0026rsquo;t worthwhile at the moment.\n","id":69,"section":"posts","summary":"Docker AWSCLI Built with Bazel  The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services.

Simple layout in code (minimal overhead), with tooling to move assets into the correct locations When working with code, the proposals have some organization mechanism Minimal barriers when trying to write a proposal  Notes Using date-based directory organization helps for filtering based on the latest proposals. If you are looking for the proposals in the most recent year, its fairly easy to complete that query (ls designs/2019/). I find that this falls apart when navigating the history for proposals related to a project. I could enforce directory naming standards, but I feel that makes the repository difficult to approach. If I want all the proposals related to a certain project, I\u0026rsquo;d need to use tools like jq or grep.\nA model that involves namespaces paired with status directories (archived/etc) would help resolve these issues. My concern with this though is the solution becomes over-engineered and closely connected to the concept of directories. I think the \u0026lsquo;Namespaces and Status\u0026rsquo; example really shows how it can become difficult to work with when sticking with tree structure for organization.\nSince each proposal is a self-contained package with metadata, the proposals can be moved freely about the file system. From this, I\u0026rsquo;d say that the best solution is to just use namespace slugs for directory names. Each proposal will have metadata in the form of the DESIGN schema, so the post-processing stage can organize it by that.\nThis repository does a simple example using mkdocs to create a website hosting the proposals. The proposals are put in hardcoded locations to avoid the need for a post-processing step.\nNamespaces and Status \u0026gt; designs/ \u0026gt; project1/ \u0026gt; sub1/ \u0026gt; remove-items-from/ \u0026gt; README.md \u0026gt; assets/ \u0026gt; diagram.png \u0026gt; establish-baseline/ \u0026gt; README.md \u0026gt; supplementary/ \u0026gt; NOTES.md \u0026gt; sub2/ \u0026gt; remove-items-from/ \u0026gt; README.md \u0026gt; project2/ \u0026gt; sandbox-components-by/ \u0026gt; README.md \u0026gt; replace-grpc-with/ \u0026gt; README.md \u0026gt; archived/ \u0026gt; 2019 \u0026gt; project1/ \u0026gt; establish-project1-for/ \u0026gt; README.md \u0026gt; 2018 \u0026gt; project2/ \u0026gt; establish-project2-for/ \u0026gt; README.md Directory scoping \u0026gt; xyz/ \u0026gt; README.md \u0026gt; DESIGN \u0026gt; assets/ \u0026gt; diagram.png \u0026gt; architecture.svg \u0026gt; supplmentary/ \u0026gt; NOTES.md \u0026gt; ESTIMATES.md ","id":83,"section":"posts","summary":"Proposals Experimenting with the underlying infrastructure for a GitHub based proposals mechanisms that deploys to a web resource (website/subpage/etc)\nMotivations  Automation to ensure contribution guidelines are both accessible and followed (e.g. first contribution bot, linting) Contribution previews, either by links to markdown rendering or branch previews Support for supplemental resources (e.g. assets/list-of-items.csv) Methods to organize the proposals better (date? slugs?

This repository is part of an original experiment\nI wanted to have an terraform executor that met the following requirements:\n Use official terraform docker image (hashicorp/terraform:light) No external dependencies or custom images (e.g. terragrunt, astro, etc) Customizable execution process with minimal overhead Support in-repository modules No credential management (AWS Codepipeline execution) Multiple AWS environments within a single repository No single state file, state file per component (controlled by terraform.tf file) State files map to location in repository Potential for custom IAM role per component (as opposed to single access permission)  This was a quick prototype to see if I would be able to get something rough running, with the shell executor being just the bare essentials that I need.\nIssues with the final result There are a couple of issues I noted when setting this up, and the eventual improvements made to the later executors. I have listed them below:\n CodePipeline requires cloudwatch to provide notifications on failure CodeBuild log for the terraform plan/show outputs is not very pretty CodePipeline is limited to a single branch, impacting the idea of \u0026lsquo;preview\u0026rsquo; builds Shell based executors are simple, but require maintenance YAML Executors (see GitLab / GitHub Actions / CircleCI) have isolated executor for each component Deployments to 2 or more accounts requires a \u0026lsquo;GitFlow\u0026rsquo; style approach, which has a lot of overhead Restricting permissions on the component level requires a fair bit of extra work, and isn\u0026rsquo;t really sound Control options are handled by files (e.g. ORDER, IGNORE, APPLY_ONLY), which doesn\u0026rsquo;t lend itself to customization well  It is nice to have everything in AWS, with serverless architecture but I find the limitations are a big issue. If I was starting from scratch, I would be interested in the idea of deploying a GitLab + GitLabCI architecture in AWS, then restricting IAM access by executors (that would be provisioned by AWS Lambda).\nThe big problems I have with this style of terraform executor is the edge cases. I\u0026rsquo;ll mention three that have bugged me the most:\nDeployments into another AWS ACcount Allowing another team (or individual) to have a component (e.g. teraform deployment) that exists within an account I own. I would want to restrict access for that role, and keep knowledge of that terraform within my infrastructure repository. Also wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to require my approval on every PR, but at the same time not allow free reign within the AWS account.\nIt is an option to just expose a role in an account, then allow the terraform+executor to be handled by the team in another repo/executor. This can mean back and forth a bit, as the IAM permissions for that role need to be fine tuned\nExisting infrastructure / failed deployments This can happen when you are not using uniqely named resources (e.g. my-s3-bucket-x2r1), where terraform will fail when it encounters an existing resource. Failures can also happen when working with a non-terraform managed resource (e.g. IAM policy usages). When using a codepipeline executor, everything is in a single log file so it can be difficult to know:\n Who failed? What resource had failed? Where is that in the repository?  Cross-cutting concerns Deployments with codepipeline executors do not work well for cross-cutting concerns. If I want to deploy something into every single AWS account (such as an IAM role or S3 bucket), it just doesn\u0026rsquo;t work well. I don\u0026rsquo;t get the advantages of parallel execution, and a failure midway cannot be reverted easily. Permissions are also way too open for my taste, in that the single executor is running in every single account within any real guard-rails.\nAt least with an external ID per account role, with isolated execution (in say GitLabCI / CircleCI) I have more confidence that I won\u0026rsquo;t see misconfiguration in an account.\n","id":124,"section":"posts","summary":"Prototype CodePipeline Terraform Repository A repository for terraform execution in a Codepipeline task.

In each round, each person can either defect by taking $1 from a (common) pile, or cooperate by giving $2 from the same pile to the other person. A purely rational agent will optimise over his expected long-term payoffs, possibly by averaging over his expectations of his opponent’s type (or strategy).\nJollyBot works by always attempting to cooperate with the opposing agent, attempting to establish mutual cooperation between the agents whenever reasonable. Even in the case of a more aggressive agent, JollyBot tries to remain jolly. The bot was developed as part of an assignment in an Artificial Intelligence course, with the goal of ultimately participating in a tournament against other submitted agents.

The framework allows multi-script execution, you can use GitHooks to automate or optimize virtually any aspect of your development workflow.\nGetting Started Git Hooks are event-based scripts you can place in a hooks directory to trigger actions at certain points in git’s execution. When you run certain git commands, the software will run the associated script within the git repository. GitHooks extends on this by enabling the installation of any arbitrary number of hooks for a command.\nInstallation You can install hooks in a git repository by two methods: unzipping then deleting, or manually copying in the scripts. Either option you will need to use the command line to setup your git repository, however it is recommended to use the unzip method as it is less likely to encounter mistakes (forgetting to set execution bit, missing a script, etc).\nUnzip githooks You can quickly install a set of hooks into the git repository by unzipping githooks.zip into the .git/hooks/ directory. To install all hooks and sub-hooks, you can do so with the following:\nunzip githooks.zip -d .git/hooks/ chmod +x .git/hooks/* You can then delete any hooks from the .git/hooks/ directory that you do not wish to use.\nManual Copying To manually install a git hook, you will need to start by copying the hook into the .git/hooks/ directory. The git hook, also known as the entrypoint hook, is responsible for executing scripts in a sub-directory. If you wish to install the commit-msg hook, you can do the following:\ncp commit-msg .git/hooks/commit-msg mkdir -p .git/hooks/commit-msg.d/ chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg After copying in the entrypoint hook, you will be able to copy hooks into a sub-directory named after the hook (e.g. commit-msg.d/). These hooks will be run by the entrypoint hook, commit-msg. To add a hook, you can do so with the following:\ncp 001-my-githook.sh .git/hooks/commit-msg.d/ This will install the hook 001-my-githook.sh into the commit-msg.d/ directory.

Friending has two primary features: joining groups to find people similar to you or signing up for events happening in your local area. Friending is a prototype built with the Proto.io application prototyping tool.\nThe Friending prototype was built as part of a requirements specification project. The project focused on the development of a user manual around a fictional matchmaking application called Friending. The application centered around user-created questionnaires that could be used to find relationship matches. The user manual was designed with the goal of deceiving the reader into believing that the application existed. A project vision document and set of user requirements guided the development of scenarios and use cases for the application. The fully-interactive high-fidelity prototype created for the requirements specification project is provided in this repository, available as a standalone HTML page.\nManual The Friending user manual provides info and tips to help you understand the mobile application. The requirements specification project involved the creation of a user manual for the fictional mobile application Friending. The Friending prototype is the actualization of a user vision and set of requirements to construct a matchmaking application. The vision and requirements were used to develop the expected behaviour of the prototype, although not all requirements were actualized into the interactive prototype. The prototype merely needed to present a faithful representation of the original vision.\nProto.io Proto.io is a web service to create fully-interactive high-fidelity prototypes that look and work exactly like your app should. No coding required. Using Proto.io you can quickly design and prototype design ideas. As the user manual was built around the fictional mobile application Friending, mockups were necessary to explain the application to the reader. Proto.io was selected for developing the mockups as they produced realistic mockups for a mobile application. Interaction was added to produce a fully-interactive prototype, which was useful in validating scenarios and use cases from the user manual. The visual design of the prototype was guided by the project vision document.\nGenerated The code provided in this repository is generated by Proto.io using the Export to HTML feature. Proto.io allows you to export your prototype so that it can be runnable as a standalone HTML page. When exported a zip package containing all necessary files to run and view the prototype is created. The code provided in this repository contains the project data files, and all the assets used in the project. As each exported prototype uses randomly generated file names for assets, this can mean that the versioning of assets is not always consistent, nor legible. The interaction code for a prototype is controlled by minimized javascript (scripts/ \u0026amp; libraries/), so it too is not legible.\nThe exported index.html file does not contain the rendered HTML pages of the prototype. The prototype pages are rendered by the Proto.io rendering engine (Javascript) which means that you should not modify any exported HTML code as this may break the presentation and functionality of the prototype. If you open the index.html file, then you will also see the respective prototype’s device skin. The exported code has been altered slightly to switch the frame.html and index.html to make use of the device skin wrapper of the prototype.\nAcknowledgements The project icon is retrieved from the Noun Project.

The project is the actualization of a user vision and set of requirements to construct a matchmaking application. The User Manual encodes these requirements as scenarios and use cases, while the Friending prototype presents a high-fidelity vision of the matchmaking application.\nFriending Friending is an online dating, friendship, and social networking mobile application that features user-created questionnaires. Friending has two primary features: joining groups to find people similar to you or signing up for events happening in your local area. Friending is a prototype built with the Proto.io application prototyping tool.\nThe Friending prototype was built as part of a requirements specification project. The project focused on the development of a user manual around a fictional matchmaking application called Friending. The application centered around user-created questionnaires that could be used to find relationship matches. The user manual was designed with the goal of deceiving the reader into believing that the application existed. A project vision document and set of user requirements guided the development of scenarios and use cases for the application. The user manual created for the requirements specification project is provided in this repository, available as a PDF.\nDevelopment If you are developing on Windows, it is recommended to install the IDE Texmaker, the universal LaTeX editor. This will ensure that the necessary TexLive packages are installed (or can be installed). The IDE Texmaker is the default IDE used in development of the project.\nBuilding You can build the image using latexmk. To build with pdf2htmlEX, you can either install pdf2htmlEX in your environment, or make use of the docker image. To start the docker image, run the following:\nsh start.sh To build with latexmk, you can do the following:\nlatexmk -pdf manual.tex It is recommend to use the build scripts available in build/. These scripts are used in the build pipeline, ensuring that all arguments and attributes are set for compilation of the TeX project. The output pdf manual.pdf is available at the project root, while other build files are available in the output/ directory.\nsh build/compile.sh Acknowledgements The project icon is retrieved from the Noun Project.

Each player picks a secret word of five letters (that is in the dictionary), and the object of the game is to correctly guess the other player\u0026rsquo;s word first. Players take turns guessing and giving the number of Jots, or the number of letters that are in both the guessed word and the secret word.\nThe Jotto application is built with a single player, playing against a computer. The objective of the game is to correctly guess the secret word before the maximum number of guesses. The user interface provides feedback about the success of each guess, and the progress being made by the player. Each guess must be validated that it is present in the dictionary, of the proper length and contains repeated characters. After each guess the player will be provided feedback about the guess, such as the number of exact character matches and the number of partial character matches.\nDevelopment If you are developing on Windows, it is recommended to install the IDE IntelliJ IDEA. This will work with the existing jotto.iml present in the jotto/ directory. The output of the build process is available in the CI artifacts browser. The artifacts have an expiration period to ensure that old build artifacts are properly cleaned up.\nBuilding You can build the image using mvn or scripts in the build/ directory. To build with maven, you can either install maven in your environment, or make use of the docker image. To start the docker image, run the following:\nsh build/start.sh To build with mvn, you can do the following:\nmvn compile It is recommend to use the build scripts available in build/.
