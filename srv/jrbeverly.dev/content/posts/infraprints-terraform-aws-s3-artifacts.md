# AWS S3 Terraform State Output

Terraform module for an tiered storage S3 bucket with eventual object expiration. Primary use key is for a build artifacts storage.

These types of resources are supported:

- [S3 Bucket](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/s3_bucket.html)

## Usage

```hcl
module "build_artifacts" {
  source = "git::https://gitlab.com/infraprints/modules/aws/s3-artifacts"

  bucket                   = "infraprints-s3-artifacts"
  standard_transition_days = 10
  glacier_transition_days  = 30
  expiration_days          = 365

  tags = {
    Longevity  = "Yearly"
    Expiration = "True"
  }
}
```

## Examples

- [Basic Example](examples/basic)
- [Adjusted Example](examples/adjusted)

## Notes

- With the default configuration, all objects in the S3 bucket will **expire** in 90 days.
- The S3 bucket uses tiered storage with eventual expiration. This bucket is not designed for long term persistence.
