# Awesome Terraform Prototype

An experiment using `mkdocs` and a series of json/yml files to define an awesome list.

The markdown files are automatically generated from the yml files that define each element of the list (tags/metadata/etc). These files are then piped into `mkdocs`, which yields a material theme website for the project.
