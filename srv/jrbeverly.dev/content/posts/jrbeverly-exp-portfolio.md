# jrbeverly portfolio

## Summary

Collections data from a specified list of gitlab projects, then converts them into static HTML briefs.

## Getting Started

The project is designed to `git clone` a series of repository, then collect information from each of them. This includes the project icon, name, license, path, etc.

From this information, the project will then for each repository create:

* A brief - A simple static page featuring the README.md of the project rendered in a viewdocs format
* A redirect link, allowing one to navigate to `jrbeverly.me/ref/reponame` to be redirected to the primary git repo
