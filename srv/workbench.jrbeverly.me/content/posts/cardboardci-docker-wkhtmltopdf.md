# Docker image for WkHtmlToPDF

wkhtmltopdf and wkhtmltoimage are open source (LGPLv3) command line tools to render HTML into PDF and various image formats using the Qt WebKit rendering engine. These run entirely "headless" and do not require a display or display service.

You can see the cli reference [here](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf).

## Usage

You can run awscli to manage your AWS services.

```bash
aws iam list-users
aws s3 cp /tmp/foo/ s3://bucket/ --recursive --exclude "*" --include "*.jpg"
aws sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/xaccounts3access --role-session-name s3-access-example
```

### Pull latest image

```bash
docker pull cardboardci/wkhtmltopdf
```

### Test interactively

```bash
docker run -it cardboardci/wkhtmltopdf /bin/bash
```

### Run basic AWS command

```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd)":/workspace cardboardci/wkhtmltopdf aws s3 cp file.txt s3://bucket/file.txt
```

### Run AWS CLI with custom profile

```bash
docker run -it -v "$(pwd)":/workspace -v "~/.aws/":/cardboardci/.aws/ cardboardci/wkhtmltopdf aws s3 cp file.txt s3://bucket/file.txt
```

### Continuous Integration Services

For each of the following services, you can see an example of this image in that environment:

* [CircleCI](usages/circleci)
* [GitHub Actions](usages/github)
* [GitLabCI](usages/gitlabci)
* [JenkinsFile](usages/jenkins)
* [TravisCI](usages/travisci)
* [Codeship](usages/codeship)

## Tagging Strategy

Every new release of the image includes three tags: version, date and `latest`. These tags can be described as such:

* `latest`: The most-recently released version of an image. (`cardboardci/wkhtmltopdf:latest`)
* `<version>`: The most-recently released version of an image for that version of the tool. (`cardboardci/wkhtmltopdf:1.0.0`)
* `<version-date>`: The version of the tool released on a specific date (`cardboarci/awscli:1.0.0-20190101`)

We recommend using the digest for the docker image, or pinning to the version-date tag. If you are unsure how to get the digest, you can retrieve it for any image with the following command:

```bash
docker pull cardboardci/wkhtmltopdf:latest
docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' cardboardci/wkhtmltopdf:latest
```

## Fundamentals

All images in the CardboardCI namespace are built from [cardboardci/ci-core](https://hub.docker.com/r/cardboardci/ci-core). This image ensures that the base environment for every image is always up to date. The [common base image](https://cardboardci.jrbeverly.dev/core/) provides dependencies that are often used building and deploying software.

By having a common base, it means that each image is able to focus on providing the optimal tooling for each development workflow.
