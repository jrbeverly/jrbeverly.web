# Rusy Bevy Baseline

Fiddling with one of the Bevy examples for provisioning a window with Bevy.

## Notes

- Initialize setup required installation of libraries like: libasound2-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.0 libudev-dev mingw-w64
- Cross-compilation works, but associated GitHub Issues seemed conflicting
- Earlier version of bevy had issue with missing audio driver (devcontainer) failing the build

Don't think will continue with this for now, maybe investigate later.
