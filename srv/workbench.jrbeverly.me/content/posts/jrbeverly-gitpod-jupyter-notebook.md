# GitPod Jupyter Notebook

Validating working with Jupyter notebooks in a GitPod environments

## Notes

- Support for preview or open in browser mode
- Initial provisioning of the image takes a bit, pre-baked likely would help in this area
- Jupyter lab is another option
- Makefile is a good option for acting as an entrypoint for common commands
- Outstanding questions still exist for multi-notebook repositories like the learning repo
