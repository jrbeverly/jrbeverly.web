# MirageJS Tutorial

Running through the (MirageJS Tutorial)[https://github.com/miragejs/tutorial] case 

## Notes

- If generated from a schema, the system is essentially
    - Backend (proper)
    - Backend Mock (in-memory)
    - Backend JS Client (proper)
    - Backend JS Client Mock (in-memory - integrated with MirageJS)
- How could this be integrated with code generation from a specification?
- Does this assist with local development?
- Test scenarios in an pseudo-E2E case?
