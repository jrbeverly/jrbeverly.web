# Rust Language Checks

Experimenting with aspects of Rustlang for working with database, and immutable data structures.

## Notes

- How might the Entity.Model apply to this? Where we split the `id` from the data struct?
- Immutable hashmap appears to need additional crates (cursory look)
- The `/src` & `/lib` standard directories is a nice component
- Using `.env` to reference the database URL
- Requires some additional components for PSQL & Diesel
