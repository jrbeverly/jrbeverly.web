It aims to create a hosted and self-hosted solution for the management of the secrets.
The hosted solution was aimed to target individuals, while the managed/self-hosted solution was available for enterprises.
Note: Development of WiseVault has ceased as of 2018
Development WiseVault was started in my enterprise co-op term. As time was limited (4 months), I set the aim of completing a prototype of WiseVault by the end of the term.</description></item></channel></rss>
